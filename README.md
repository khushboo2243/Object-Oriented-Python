# Object-Oriented-Python
This repository comprises of small programs using Object Oriented Proagramming in Python.
The files are commented so as to make sense of the codes. 
The codes are a part of video lectures, I completed in order to learn OOP Python. : https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsqhIuOqKhwlXsIBIdSeYtc

The codes can be used as a shorter way to go through OOP Python. Comments can be used for understanding.
